morning 

have a class meeting and know the basic info of my new term ,
got to know a new guy of my class

sometimes when we try to judge someone or get along with the one who around you , the most aspect that we cared is how he or she performed and will that be excellent or just an ordinary level.
to some extend, it's unfair, and may be lack of evidence. 
the condition is complete,  you shouldn't use one standard to evaluate all guys.
