### keep on

today seems not to be a cheerful day .

first list some thing that annoy me whole time:

- the computer problem 
when I install photoshop ps6 to check the .psd file , that was the begin of my terrible day. The computer begin to restart again and again and show the same error info KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE. what else, the hard disk became very slow , and it took me very long time to open and wait for the file to response.
**it almost drive me crazy!**

- the problem with node_module
when I run gulp dev command, it shows the error there some `unexpect token {` in the modules, I guess that was something wrong with it and delete it and run npm install again, that works.

- the next problem is about the path 
when I edit the head.jade , I import bootstrap and jquery with relative path ,but when it start to package and the Request URL changed to 

	http://s2.sjbly.cn/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css
	and of course it dosen't the right way.
