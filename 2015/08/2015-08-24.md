>React 标榜自己是 MVC 里面 V 的部分，那么 Flux 就相当于添加 M 和 C 的部分。
Flux 是 Facebook 使用的一套前端应用的架构模式。
		
一个 Flux 应用主要包含四个部分:

- the dispatcher //处理动作分发，维护 Store 之间的依赖关系

- the stores //数据和逻辑部分

- the views //React 组件，这一层可以看作 control	ler-views，作为视图同时响应用户交互

- the actions //提供给 dispatcher 传递数据给 store


了解一下 Flux 的核心“单向数据流“怎么运作的

#### Action -> Dispatcher -> Store -> View

## Je ne joue pas

I do not have a gentle heart.

For several times that I have indicated that **don't attempt to judge me with YOUR VALUES**

But I have to recognize something unfortunately which might hurt more ———— maybe someone donot have a commen sense of **real values** inside at all.

rediculous.

unpardonable.

and I have mercy on you , genuine .

I've heart a story about how to get along with someone you
think is worthy intercoursing  deeply , first and the basic way is to be frank . 

show him or her who you're , what you think actually , no pretending , no fear to set out the tender self-esteem .

Do you really hope someone will always lose sight of the essencial ideas and still get the fake point of you?

I am get tired .

Je ne joue pas .
