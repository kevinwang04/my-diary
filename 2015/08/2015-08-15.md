some sentences that catch my feeling



- How many times do I have to tell you,Even when you're crying you're beautiful too.The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood,You're my downfall, you're my muse.My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues

- I couldn't promise you a beautiful tomorrow , but I will take you to create a interesting lifetime.

- sometimes everï¼Œsometimes never.
