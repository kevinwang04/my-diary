### What Does Lorem Ipsum Mean?

> At some point in time, almost everyone has encountered text that reads Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet… It’s used all over the place and theories on what it is range from it being a secret illuminati code, to it being complete nonsense. Let’s explore.

- **Is Lorem Ipsum Nonsense?**

Lorem ipsum might have been in use since the 1500’s but it has definitely been in use since at least the 1960’s. Back then veteran graphic designers used letraset sheets each of different fonts and font sizes to make up pages of type. Some of these sheets came with the Lorem ipsum passage on them.

It was made more popular in graphic design circles when DTP was born because it came installed with Aldus Pagemaker. In the advertising world the copy is called greek text which is strange because it’s Latin.

The Latin in the text is actually derived from Cicero’s De finibus bonorum et malorum (On the ends of good and evil) and mixed in with the Platonism of Antiochus of Ascalon but it’s scrambled like an egg until only nonsense remains. So, sorry to say but yes, it is mostly nonsense. But let’s see if we can translate it.

The first few sentences are:

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nam hendrerit nisi sed sollicitudin pellentesque. Nunc posuere purus rhoncus pulvinar aliquam. Ut aliquet tristique nisl vitae volutpat. Nulla aliquet porttitor venenatis. Donec a dui et dui fringilla consectetur id nec massa. Aliquam erat volutpat. Sed ut dui ut lacus dictum fermentum vel tincidunt neque. 

It’s not possible to translate it, it’s mixed up copy. But the original passages do show through, so some translation is possible. Jaspreet Singh Boparai (a Cambridge University graduate) came up with the following translation:

Rrow itself, let it be sorrow; let him love it; let him pursue it, ishing for its acquisitiendum. Because he will ab hold, unless but through concer, and also of those who resist. Now a pure snore disturbeded sum dust. He ejjnoyes, in order that somewon, also with a severe one, unless of life. May a cusstums offficer somewon nothing of a poison-filled. Until, from a twho, twho chaffinch may also pursue it, not even a lump. But as twho, as a tank; a proverb, yeast; or else they tinscribe nor. 

Still garbage, but at least you now know what you’ve been pasting in all this time.
